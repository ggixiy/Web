                <h3>Special features of mountain bike</h3>
				<p>A mountain bicycle, or MTB, is built specifically for riding on rough, uneven, and challenging terrain. Unlike road or gravel bikes, mountain bikes feature wide, knobby tires that provide excellent traction on dirt, rocks, mud, and roots. They often include suspension systems — either front suspension (hardtail) or both front and rear suspension (full-suspension) — to absorb shocks and make riding over obstacles smoother and safer.</p>
                <p>Mountain bikes have strong, durable frames and a wide range of gears to help riders tackle steep climbs as well as fast descents. Their handlebars are flat or slightly curved, giving the rider more control and stability when maneuvering on trails. Powerful disc brakes are another standard feature, ensuring reliable stopping power even in wet or muddy conditions.</p>

						<p>These bikes are ideal for adventurous riders who enjoy exploring forests, mountains, and off-road trails. They are also used in competitive disciplines such as cross-country, downhill, and enduro racing. While mountain bikes can be ridden on pavement, they are heavier and less efficient on smooth roads compared to road or gravel bikes. Overall, they are best suited for those seeking adrenaline, durability, and performance in challenging environments.</p>
