                <h3>Special features of gravel bike</h3>
				<p>A gravel bicycle is a versatile bike designed to handle a wide variety of surfaces, from smooth pavement to rough dirt trails. It combines elements of road and mountain bikes, making it an excellent choice for riders who want both speed and stability. Gravel bikes typically feature wider tires than road bikes, often with tread patterns that provide better grip on loose terrain. They also have a more relaxed geometry, offering comfort and control on long rides and uneven surfaces.</p>
                <p>These bikes are built for endurance and adventure. They usually come with multiple mounting points for racks, bags, and water bottles, making them ideal for bikepacking and long-distance touring. The gearing is designed to handle climbs as well as flat stretches, giving riders flexibility across different types of terrain.</p>
