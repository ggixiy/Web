                <h3>Special features of fixed-gear</h3>
				<p>A fixed-gear bicycle, often called a fixie, is a type of bike that has a drivetrain with no freewheel mechanism. This means that the pedals are always in motion when the rear wheel is turning — if the wheel spins, so do the cranks. Unlike most modern bicycles, a fixie doesn’t allow coasting, so the rider must keep pedaling at all times.</p>
                <p>Fixed-gear bikes are known for their simplicity and minimalism: they usually have fewer components, often just one gear, and in many cases no traditional brakes (riders slow down by resisting pedal motion). Because of this design, they are lightweight, efficient, and require very little maintenance compared to geared bikes.</p>
                <p>They are commonly used in velodrome racing, urban commuting, and by cycling enthusiasts who enjoy the direct connection between rider and bike. Riding a fixie improves pedaling technique, strength, and control, making it popular among couriers and fitness-focused cyclists.</p>

						<p>However, fixed-gear bicycles may not be suitable for beginners or hilly terrains, since they demand constant pedaling and can be physically demanding. They are best suited for experienced riders, city streets, and flat landscapes, where their speed and simplicity shine.</p>
